Call For Papers SAMOS VII
(2nd call - SUBMISSION DEADLINE: February 9, 2007)
(paper submission site opens soon)

International Symposium on Systems, Architectures, MOdeling, and
Simulation  (SAMOS VII)
Samos, Greece, July 16-19, 2007

http://ce.et.tudelft.nl/samos/samos_vii/

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SAMOS is a premier and well-established symposium on embedded
systems organized annually since 2001. The symposium brings together
researchers from academia and industry on the quiet and inspiring
northern mountainside of the Mediterranean island of Samos. It
provides an environment where collaboration rather than competition
is fostered.

The symposium comprises two co-located events:

* International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems:
  Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation (IC-SAMOS)

  The conference considers new state-of-the-art mature research papers
  on all aspects of embedded processor hardware/software design and
  integration. The IC-SAMOS is an IEEE co-sponsored conference (by both
  the IEEE CAS Society and the IEEE Germany SSCS chapter) and the
  conference proceedings will be published in the IEEE series.

* International Workshop on Systems, Architectures, Modeling, and
  Simulation (SAMOS Workshop)

  The workshop considers state-of-the-art research papers as well as
  papers on ongoing work with promising preliminary results. Positional
  and in-depth review papers are also considered. Furthermore, the
  workshop covers additional topics compared to IC-SAMOS that are
  complementary to processing and necessary to build embedded systems,
  e.g., sensor systems. The workshop proceedings will be published by
  Springer Verlag in the LNCS series.

The IC-SAMOS topics of interest are: (but not limited to)

* Application-specific/Domain-specific Embedded Systems
* Profiling, Measurement and Analysis Techniques for Embedded Systems
* Hardware/Software Co-design
* Design Space Exploration
* System-Level Design, Simulation, and Verification
* Embedded Reconfigurable Processors
* Multimedia and Graphics Architectures
* Energy-Aware and Low-Power Processors
* Embedded Parallel Systems
* Application Specifications and Modeling for Embedded Systems
* Memory Management, Smart Caches, and Compiler Controlled Memories
* Design, Specification and Synthesis of Embedded Systems
* Compilers and Mapping Technologies
* Multi-threaded Processors
* Computer Aided Design
* Specification Languages and Models
* Processor Simulation Technologies
* Novel Architectures and Micro-architectures for Embedded Systems
* Network-on-Chip Platforms
* Multi-Processor Systems-on-Chip
* Digital Signal Processors

The SAMOS Workshop covers the following topics: (but not limited to)

* System-Level Design, Simulation, and Verification
* Multimedia and Graphics Architectures
* Embedded Software

* Computer Aided Design
* Component-based Design and Analysis
* Physical Design
* Application-specific Systems (e.g., automotive)
* Implantable Systems
* Specification Languages and Models
* Applications of Embedded Systems
* Network-on-Chip Platforms
* Multi-Processor Systems-on-Chip
* Programming models for multi-processor embedded systems
* Embedded Parallel Systems
* Networked Embedded Systems and Security
* Embedded System-on-a-Chip Implementations
* Multi-threaded Processors
* High-Level, Architectural, and System Level Synthesis
* Digital Signal Processors
* Performance Analysis of Embedded Systems
* Embedded Operating Systems
* Real-time Embedded Systems
* Memory Management, Smart Caches, and Compiler Controlled Memories
* Embedded Reconfigurable Processors
* Reliable and Trustworthy Embedded Systems

The SAMOS conference and workshop have established a tradition of
not only presenting new results but also bringing to the audience
open challenging problems and on-the-stage requests for suggestions
for solutions. In addition of considering only new innovative
research, submissions of works in progress, positional, and review
of the state of the art papers are also encouraged.
