Colleagues, students, friends,

  Micro-31, the 31st International Symposium on Microarchitecture, will
be held in Dallas, Texas on 30 NOV - 02 DEC 1998.  In the 1990's, MICRO
has become the premier forum for discussing advancements in
microarchitecture and in compiler techniques that together enable higher
computing performance, especially through increased exploitation of
instruction-level parallelism (ILP).  Micro-31 aims to continue and even
strengthen this tradition when we reconvene in Dallas later this year.

  We invite you to join us at Micro-31.  As you plan your participation,
visit our web site at http://www.acm.org/sigmicro/micro31/ for full
information on the overall conference schedule, the detailed program,
and registration.  Discounted "early" registration is available through
Friday 06 NOV.

  Micro-31's main program thread, from Monday morning 30 NOV through
Wednesday noon 02 DEC, contains our keynote address, an excellent slate
of papers, and 1 special lecture.  Surrounding this technical centerpiece
are an optional workshop and tutorial on the preceding Sunday 29 NOV and
a bonus tutorial following on Wednesday afternoon.  Taken together, these
events offer attendees a truly excellent, value-packed program.

  See you later this year at Micro-31 in Dallas, Texas!

Regards,
Jim Bondi, Jim Smith, & Micro-31 Organizers

TUTORIAL ABSTRACTS

Tutorial 1: Compilers for Embedded Processors: Technology and New Challenges

Tuesday, 8:30AM - 12Noon

Presenter: Rainer Leupers, Aachen University of Technology

Abstract: Programmable processors are among the major building blocks
in today's embedded SoC designs. In contrast to desktop systems, there
is a huge variety of domain specific and even application specific
architectures, including microcontrollers, DSPs, NPUs, and ASIPs.  The
irregular architectures and very high code quality demands of embedded
processors create a need for new compiler techniques beyond classical
Dragon Book compilation. This tutorial gives an overview of today's
retargetable compiler and code optimization technology for embedded
processors, while also touching further important software development
tools.  Additionally, new research challenges in the areas of
architecture exploration and compilation for recent architecture
families like VLIWs and NPUs will be covered.

Tutorial 2: Software Performance Analysis for Real-Time Embedded Systems

Tuesday, 1:30PM - 5PM

Presenters: Rolf Ernst, Technical University of Braunschweig
            Reinhard Wilhelm, University of SaarbrÂcken        

Abstract: Run-time guarantees play an important role in the area of
embedded systems and especially hard real-time systems. These systems
are typically subject to stringent timing constraints which often
result from the interaction with the surrounding physical
environment. It is essential that the computations are completed
within their associated time bounds; otherwise severe damages may
result. Therefore, a schedulability analysis has to be performed which
guarantees that all timing constraints will be met (also called timing
validation).  The complex processor architectural features, such as
caches and pipelines make the analysis of the software execution
behavior very difficult.  In this tutorial, the approaches for
computing reliable worst-case execution times for real-time software
will be presented. Techniques for analyzing the overall system-level
time behavior will also be discussed.
